# Swift News App Proposal
By Trevor Henrich

It has never been so exhausting to stay informed using online news sources. Newsly aims to simplify reading the news while also giving the reader an opportunity to offer meaningful engagement. This project seeks to connect users with todays latest headlines. Users can read articles, search for articles, and sort by category. If the user finds a meaningful article, they can bookmark the article to be viewed at a later date, even if the app closes. News is delivered via NewsApi.org where the user can search or organize news articles via category. Articles can be bookmarked for later reading that is persistant between uses.
